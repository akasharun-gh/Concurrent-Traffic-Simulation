# Concurrent Traffic Simulation

## About
This project uses a real urban map to simulate traffic behavior and is based on the concepts of concurrency and multi-threaded programming. The project involves building a suitable and thread-safe communication protocol between vehicles and intersections with the simulation of traffic lights also integrated within the code. Throughout the project, concurrent programming concepts (such as mutexes, locks and message queues) have been utilized to implement and simulate the traffic behaviour within the map with representations of vehicles, intersections and traffic lights.  

This is the project for the fourth course in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213): Concurrency. 

The 'gif' below represents the final expected output of the project.
